 I enjoy working in both front-end and back-end applications but gravitate naturally toward back-end data management in SQL or NoSQL databases. 

My background as a career changer provides me with a unique perspective in my approach to coding. I have a strong bias toward <strong><span class="text-info">impact</span></strong>, <strong><span class="text-info">results</span></strong> and <strong><span class="text-info">user application</span></strong>, and can quickly see how small pieces fit in the larger picture.


I lived and worked in India for three years and have a Master's degree in Intercultural studies, with an emphasis on international and urban development principles. My life abroad and work with all sorts of cultures makes me highly perceptive to cultural dyanmics - and I believe that has a critical impact on team formation, understanding client needs, and product development.
