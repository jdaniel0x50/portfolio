In my personal time, I love to hike, camp, and ride my motorcycle in the summer months. I learned to ride a couple years ago, and am hooked. In the spirit of being a problem solver and an engineer, I usually attempt to do my own motorcycle and car maintenance or small home projects. I am also an avid reader and trying to learn to paint.
