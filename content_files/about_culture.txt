I lived and worked in India for three years and have a Master's degree in Intercultural studies, with an emphasis on international and urban development principles. My life abroad and work with all sorts of cultures makes me highly perceptive to cultural dyanmics - and I believe that has a critical impact on team formation, understanding client needs, and product development.
