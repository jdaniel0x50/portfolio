I am a full stack software engineer specializing in <strong><span class="text-info">Python</span></strong>, <strong><span class="text-info">.NET</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="text-info">MEAN</span></strong> frameworks, and a career changer with over <u><strong>10 years</strong></u> of former career experience as an electrical engineer, project manager, and nonprofit services manager. In the course of my career, I designed databases for two different nonprofit agencies and realized how much I enjoy creating software solutions that make a profound difference on business objectives. 

I recently completed an intensive software development training program through Coding Dojo, in Chicago, IL. I am a <strong><span class="text-info">prolific learner</span></strong>, extraordinary <strong><span class="text-info">problem solver</span></strong>, and driven to <strong><span class="text-info">constantly improve</span></strong> not only myself but every organization and team I have been a part of.
