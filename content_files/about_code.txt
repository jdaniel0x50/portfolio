I have built projects in <strong><span class="text-info">Python/Django</span></strong>, <strong><span class="text-info">C#/.NET Core Entity Framework</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="text-info">Node.js/Angular (MEAN)</span></strong>. I've also designed fully integrated databases at nonprofit agencies that are being used to search and track incidents of human trafficking, manage refugee resettlement cases, and connect volunteers and donors with refugee families.

My background has uniquely qualified me to be a comprehensive software engineer. My electrical engineering and program management training equips me to see how code components fit in larger applications and business processes - and makes me an extraordinary problem solver. My nonprofit services experience gives me a strong bias to design tools that maximize impact and are easy to use.
